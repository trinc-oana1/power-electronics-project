# Power Electronics project
This repository contains my work for a university project in Power Electronics. It involves the analysis and simulation of DC-DC converters using MATLAB/Simulink. Throughout the project, I performed component sizing, steady-state analysis, and modeled circuit behavior in different operating conditions. The project improved my ability to work with technical documentation and simulation tools.
